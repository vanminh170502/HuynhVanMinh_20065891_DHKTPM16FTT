        <p> A smile is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing the muscles at the sides of the mount. It is believed it takes about 80 muscles to smile. Some smiles include a contraction of the muscles at the comer of the eyes, an action known as a "Duchene smile".Smile performed without the eye contraction may be perceived as insincere.
